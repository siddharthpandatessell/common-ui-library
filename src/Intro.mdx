# Get started

Tessell Design System(TDS) is a reusable component library that helps contributors build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Install

TDS components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

Add TDS to your project.

`npm install --save tessell/design-system`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button, Badge } from 'tessel/design-system';`

and use them like so

```js
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Badge onClick={() => clear()}>Cool</Badge>
    </div>
  )
```

### **Browse TDS components in your own Storybook**

Once you add the package, update your .storybook/config.js to import all files ending in .stories.js.

```html
  import { configure } from '@storybook/react';
  configure(require.context('../src', true, /.stories.js$/), module);
```

### **Run and develop TDS locally**

Clone the [TDS GitHub project](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system) then start Storybook.

`yarn && yarn run storybook`
